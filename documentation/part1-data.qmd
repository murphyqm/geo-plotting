title: 1. Data

All data analysis should be done in a dedicated version controlled repository.

It is oftentimes a good idea (if the data is open) to save this as a public repository, and in your visualisation/dashboard repository, simply point to the URL of this data.

Exploration and analysis of the data should be kept separate from the communication and visualisation of the data; this ensures your dashboard is useful and clear for the users.

Your cleaned and analysed datasets should be saved in a common data format (for example, `geojson`) in a repository that also tracks the cleaning and analysis steps (for example, in a git repository).

This dataset can have a DOI minted and citation metadata added.

Any future updates or edits to the dataset will be obvious and visible, supporting open research and reproducibility.
